				<h2>Inspiration</h2>
				<p>
					When I read the article, it was talking about climate change and architectures. I thought about buildings that are rising up. So, I wanted to add animation to "rectangles" at the bottom of the screen which represents buildings/architectures that are building and impacting our planet. I wanted to use black, white and grey color scheme to show those architecture/buildings stripped the nature of earth.

					In terms of color scheme, at first I wanted to use bright colors that represents the earth and the ecosystem. However I felt like the nature color scheme doesnt suit with the "architectural/buildings" theme. So, I was thinking another animation where the colors could transition into black and white.

					I actually struggled with my own custom fonts because I wasn't able to scale it down. I feel like a different custom font would have looked better but due to the timing I was not able to make proper adjustment besides changing the color.
